📊 Azure Data Pipeline: Data Ingestion, Transformation, and Visualization
🌟 Overview
This project implements a comprehensive data pipeline using Azure Data Lake Gen 2 for data ingestion, Apache Spark in Databricks for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, and Azure Synapse Analytics for data pipelining and visualization. The pipeline culminates in an interactive dashboard for insightful data analysis. 🚀


🏗 Architecture

1. 📥 Data Ingestion
Source: Ingest data from sources such as flat files (CSV, JSON), databases, or APIs.
Destination: Store raw data in Azure Data Lake Gen 2.

2. 🔄 Data Transformation (ETL)

Tool: Use Apache Spark in Databricks for data cleaning, transformation, and enrichment.
Output: Save processed data back to Azure Data Lake Gen 2 or move it to Azure Synapse Analytics.

3. 🚦 Data Pipelining and Visualization

Pipelines: Set up Azure Synapse Analytics pipelines for further data processing.
Dashboard: Visualize data insights using Power BI or Synapse Studio.

🔧 Technologies Used
1. Azure Data Lake Gen 2: 🗂️ Scalable storage for raw and processed data.
1. Apache Spark (Databricks): ⚡ Distributed computing for ETL workflows.
Azure Synapse Analytics: 🌉 Unified platform for data integration and analysis.
Power BI or Synapse Studio: 📊 Interactive dashboards for business insights.

🔑 Access and Permissions
Ensure access to all relevant Azure resources (Data Lake, Databricks, Synapse).
Assign proper roles (e.g., Storage Blob Contributor, Synapse User).

🛠️ Setup
1. Configure Azure Data Lake Gen 2
Create a storage account and container for raw and processed data.
2. Set Up Databricks
